## In order to achieve a successful random password generator I had to refactor my JavaScript code multiple times.This project provided some hands on practice with JavaScript engineering by adding some functionality to the button

If anyone would like to work on/add to this project it is recommended to first follow these steps:

- Download Visual Studio Code: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>

- Pull the files frop my GitHub Profile Repository: <https://github.com/lukedenhartog/passwordgenerator-03>

- It is recommended to have to latest version of Google Chrome which can be found here: <https://www.google.com/chrome/>.

## Usage

 This (<https://lukedenhartog.github.io/passwordgenerator-03/>) project displays a web based program that asks the user what kind of characters they would like to include and creates a random password generated via JavaScript functions/loops. This module will also be added to a github to display my experience to future visitors to my github page.

If any users have any questions about how to start the project they can reach me at <lukeadenhartog@gmail.com>.
